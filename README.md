The main goal is to create a simple framework for text base UI which is usable on desktop and touchable devices, as well.

## Main concepts

* Input is only plain text (*touch friendly* command line)
* Minimalistic user interface
* Usage of **immutable** view models
* Build in support for intellisense, *"did you mean?"* correction system
* Integration of **markdown** language
* Rich system of commands, actions and results

## Minimalistic UI

1. Command line
2. Result view
3. Layers? (intellisense, work in progress/background)
4. Tabs?

> Prompts: **t>**, **tu>**, **to>**, **tm>**

* Markdown language / HTML
* Command tree definition
* Intellisense, help
* *Did you mean?* correction system
* Long-running / background commands

## In progress
